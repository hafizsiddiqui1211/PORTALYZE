# Smart Resume & Portfolio Analyzer Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
All resume/portfolio insights must reflect the actual content and ATS standards. ATS score computation must follow industry-standard keyword matching and role-specific evaluation.

### Actionable Feedback
Suggestions must be practical, specific, and measurable (e.g., 'Add quantifiable metrics to your projects'). Feedback must be actionable and clearly categorized (strengths, weaknesses, suggested improvements).

### User-Centric Clarity
Feedback must be presented in a concise, visually structured manner suitable for non-technical users. Dashboard is clean, intuitive, and color-coded by sections.

### AI-Assisted Intelligence
Recommendations must leverage AI reasoning, keyword extraction, and pattern analysis. Job role suggestions must align with the candidate's experience, skills, and industry selection.

### Data Privacy
All uploaded files and profile data must be securely handled; no permanent storage without user consent. Data privacy ensured with optional user history storage.

### Performance
Analysis for a single resume must complete within 10–15 seconds. Tech stack compliance: Streamlit frontend, Python backend, OpenAI Agents SDK/GPT for AI analysis, SQL for data storage.

## Key Standards
Resume/portfolio parsing must extract text reliably from PDF/DOCX/LinkedIn/GitHub. Report export must support PDF generation of analysis. Recommendations for content, formatting, and portfolio improvements must be context-aware. Optional AI-generated bio must be personalized, concise, and relevant to the candidate's profile.

## Development Workflow
Phase-wise delivery: MVP must have ATS score correctly calculated and justified. Optional AI bio must be coherent, professional, and enhance candidate profile.

## Governance
All implementations must comply with these principles. Success criteria include: job role recommendations are relevant and aligned with skills/experience, and optional AI bio is coherent, professional, and enhances candidate profile.
